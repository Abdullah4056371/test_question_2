### Brief

In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific
words in them.

For example:

```text
jefblpepre
camdcimgtc
oivokprjsm
pbwasqroua
rixilelhrs
wolcqlirpc
screeaumgr
alxhpburyi
jalaycalmp
clojurermt
```

There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.

Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left,
vertical and diagonal.

Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first and last
letter of each word.


## Setup

```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

### Evaluation Criteria

- JavaScript best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?


### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes 
to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
